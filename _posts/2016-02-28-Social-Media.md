Social Media:

A lot of social media is out there. Therefore a lot of messages are out there. But what actually happens on the other end?

A lot.

	Let's take an innocent message:

**"ON HOLIDAY IN MOROCCO!!! LOVELY PLACE!"**

     Most people would think "That's nice"

Some would think "Wish I was there"

But a couple would think "So your house is empty?"

This isn't the only example, either.

* Phone numbers

* Parties

* Holidays

* Arguments

* Personal information

All of these are bad posts. Anyone can access your details, and it could affect your career, as an extreme.

However, some things are harmless.

	Another innocent message:

**"My cat's so funny! :DDD :)"**

     What can you gather from that? They like their cat?

	And there are other things people like.

* Funny pictures

* Funny .gif files

* Quotes

* Funny ideas/concepts/posts

In short, social media needs careful consideration before you post.
