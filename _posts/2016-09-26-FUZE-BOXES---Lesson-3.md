    <td>We used trial and error to learn firsthand, and made sure to correct mistakes. This was effective because it meant that we knew how to do more things than if we had left the mistakes; we wouldn't make the mistake again and we wouldn’t be able to go on and learn more unless we corrected it.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Will didn’t have a memory stick so it took more time to put our FUZE Box away since Nick had to help Will. Also, our mouse became disconnected halfway through, so we needed to reconnect it, but Nick wanted to get us a new mouse, so we had to set that one up. Next time, we could check if the person we’re working next to has a memory stick first.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time, we’ll pack away quicker and be more efficient so we can get more done in the lesson. Also, we can save pieces with more relevant names so they’re easier to find. We can also type quicker so we can get more done in the lesson, and we can communicate so we know what each other want to do. This is more relevant as Nick controls the mouse and has the booklet, while I use the keyboard.</td>
