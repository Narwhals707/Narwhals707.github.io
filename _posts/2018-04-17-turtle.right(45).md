Today, we worked on making our designs in 3D. It seemed complicated at first but I managed to figure out pretty quickly how to make it all line up. All I had to do was create lines coming off of each corner at 45 degrees and connect them up correctly. I found some difficulties in working out whether or not the turtle should turn left or right at points, as well as finding where I made mistakes in my code.

Possibly the most challenging bit of the lesson, though, was working out the distances for me. As each of the diagonal lines goes 50 units - the same as the horizontal and vertical lines - I had to work out the distance the turtle had to travel to meet perfectly with the edges using a trigonometry calculator at times.

Overall, I think the lesson was mostly successful, though I didn't finish putting everything into 3D, and I only got halfway there. I think this was because it was much more challenging to work out a good route for the turtle to take in 3D than in 2D. I think I mightâ€™ve been able to save lots of time by approximating the distances instead, as I doubled back on them anyway.
