    <td>As always, I worked my way through the set material. However, this week, I found that less people were asking for help. This meant that I got through more material than the last couple of weeks. Another thing which I changed was how I worked at a more consistent rate, and slowed down on some of the more important sections. This was really helpful for me and I managed to get double the work done this week compared to last week.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to make sure that I keep working at this rate and that I don't slow down again. I think that one of the things that will cause me to slow down is comparing myself with others. If I get ahead of the people I’m comparing myself with, I don’t have a clear target in mind. I need to make sure to set my own target, and not worry about other people’s work. Overall, though, I’m happy with the rate at which I am getting through the course.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time, I will make sure to make my targets clear before the lesson, and make them fixed rather than adjustable ('30 more questions or 1 more chapter’ instead of ‘more than John or learn lots of words’). I will also make sure that I keep working at a consistent rate, because I found this to be much more useful than what I was doing before, where I would skim over some important vocab and spend a long time on the more difficult questions. I should also make sure that my rate of work doesn’t slow down and I don’t spend too long looking over easy things (such as boolean operators).</td>
