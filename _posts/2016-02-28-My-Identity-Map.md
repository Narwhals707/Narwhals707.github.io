My Identity Map:

Last week, you'll notice we did "identity maps". We reviewed them today.

	Creating the identity map took a while. Luckily for me, as I am quite artistic, I enjoyed it, and so it felt shorter, but it probably took me 1-2 hours, and friction burn from the colouring in…

     I felt comfortable sharing the information, however. I didn't put anything potentially dangerous on there, and no biased comments.

     As we commented on each other's identity maps, I found that it was a lot easier to post positive comments rather than negative comments, yet I knew that giving all positive comments wouldn’t help anyone improve.

     I believe that this process of writing down comments was a better idea, as it was easier writing comments down then conveying them face-to-face as:

* It's organised

* It's quicker

* It's easier to tell them negative comments (should you need to).

     What surprised me about this was that nobody criticised mine. I suppose, and I don't mean to brag, I did get an A*. The comments were generally informative though.

     Going back to the commenting, I think that you convey more information when you can't see the person, as they might not understand you, and the more you write, the safer.

     I found that this process highlighted the important areas and where to post them (personal information privately, less serious and personal information publicly).

     So, based upon that, I think I should use around 1 form of online media, to find people to help with the business, but contacting friends and workers remains private.

     I believe these lessons changed my view of social media in a working environment, but my view on it remains mainly the same.

     To recap my usage, I believe I'll be using one online media (e.g. Facebook) but mostly privately.
