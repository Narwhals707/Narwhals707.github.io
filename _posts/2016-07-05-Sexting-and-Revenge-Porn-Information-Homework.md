Summary:

According to the labour party, sexting is more frequent amongst young teens nowadays, and the government is refusing to "protect the smartphone generation". They also have plans to make PSHE classes covering sex education compulsory.

	Many are heavily against sexting, and offences amongst young teens has risen by well over 600 since 2013, partially because young teens are lying about their age to gain access to sites such as Tinder.

	Labour also argues that good PSHE teaching will help protect children from usage of drugs and radicalisation supposedly.
