Media (Continued)

Have you ever been on Wikipedia? How about Facebook (which you shouldn't be on, unless you’re over 13)? These are both two completely different examples of media.

	You probably have been on them, but you can't rely on it to always tell the truth.

     For example, you've probably seen an ad/advert/advertisement. Let’s take a Dyson vacuum cleaner advert. They might show it off in a white room, to show efficiency. They might also use a regular room, to show it works on all surfaces.

     However, results are commonly exaggerated. Say this was the carpet before:

:;::;

::;;;

;;:;;

     It would supposedly become this:

    And it would probably become this:

.   

  .

 .

	This is a common example of misleading media. This also happens in Vanish, Cillit Bang, and other cleaning products adverts. They all show it compared to another product. That product must be *terrible, *if they all perform so well against it.

     And that's not the end. You’ll commonly find that in a corner, at the top or at the bottom, it says something like "Terms and conditions apply" or “Time lapse over 72 hours”. These are there to stop them being taken to court, as it still says so in the advert.

But of course, most people don't read the small print...
