    <td>As with all the previous weeks, we "learned by doing"/ coded first-hand. This week we also started to implement things from past weeks to refresh our understanding of the work and to explore the function of each line. As usual, Nick controlled the mouse and booklet, while I typed it up.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>While implementing ideas from previous lessons is good, what the text is replaced with is debatable. Next time, it would be quicker not to go back and change any text as this wastes time (the only exception is a typo). Also, similar to last issue, it's easier to have sensible file names, but, as previously stated, it is a hindrance to keep changing them.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time, we should work faster and not go back to change previous lines of code. Also, we can only test the code once/briefly so we donâ€™t slow down too much that way. This will mean that we can get through more work, hopefully 1.5 sections each lesson (including the assessments).</td>
