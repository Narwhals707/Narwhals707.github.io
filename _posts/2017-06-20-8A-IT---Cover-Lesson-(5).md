    <td>Instead of doing the Codecademy course this lesson, Mr Keen taught both groups doing IT. At first he talked about how it is important to break down instructions as much as possible to the computer, and how we shouldn't make assumptions in our code or it will do a completely different thing. We then went on to discuss how simple code can get, and how eventually it can reach the point of a series of 1s and 0s (1 = on, 0 = off). We then talked about colour (specifically how shadows make the world look 3D, how "the dress" works, and how space is brown). We didn’t use the computers to code this lesson, but we still learned a lot from the conversation.</td>

    <td>There isn’t really much for me to work on because I didn’t do much (only listened), but I need to make sure I don’t get distracted from other things going on (especially conversations at the back of the classroom). There wasn’t really much to work on this lesson.</td>

    <td>Once again, there isn’t much to change. However, one thing that has changed is my understanding of the world, how we see things, and coding; I need to make sure I pay lots of attention to how thoroughly I explain things in my code. Probably the most important thing for me to do with my code is to make sure I use colons in the correct places, because I have missed out lots of them in code I have previously done, and it is tedious to go back through my code, placing in the occasional colon. Overall, though, if there’s anything to correct, it would be my understanding.</td>
