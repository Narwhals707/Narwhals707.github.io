Binary and Hexadecimal:

Binary and Hexadecimal. You might've heard of them, you might not have. They’re used in computers for storing data. They simply work in different "bases". Binary works in base 2, hence BInary. Hexadecimal works in base 16, hence HEXADECimal.

	Binary is simple. 2 digits used, 1 and 0.

   You simply use the 2 digits like we all have learned. 0... 1... That column is full so we move onto the next column… 10… 11… That one is full too… 100… 101… 110… 111.

Quite simple?

It can be even simpler. Simply count numbers in ascending order using only 1s and 0s.

Binary can also be converted into base 10. To convert to binary:

Find numbers by starting with one and doubling (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 etc.).

Then, using these numbers, (your number)=__+__(add more if necessary).*

     Say you want 6 in binary. 6=4+2. now, look at the sequence. Working your way backwards, put 1s in columns being used, and 0s in columns not being used.

     Most people exclude any numbers larger than the highest number used, but computers have 0s at the start, so 6 is 110 in binary.

          To convert to base 10:

Basically do the process in reverse. 110 uses the columns 4 and 2, 4+2=6.

6 is your answer.

*Numbers can't be used more than once.

	Hexadecimal seems harder, but really isn't. 0=0, 1=1, 2=2, 3=3, 4=4, 5=5, 6=6, 7=7, 8=8, 9=9… But you’re out of digits. So we use letters. 10=A, 11=B, 12=C, 13=D, 14=E, 15=F.

     Then, just like binary, move onto the next column. 10, 11, 12, 13… 1A, 1B, etc.

	Hexadecimal to base 10 and base 10 to hexadecimal uses the same process as binary, so it doesn't need explaining. (Remember A=11 B=12 etc.).

Finally, storage. Storage starts with a bit, and goes to a gegobyte. Here's the units in order.

Bit

Nibble/Nybble/Nyble

Byte

Kilobyte

Megabyte

Gigabyte

Terabyte

Petabyte

Exabyte

Zettabyte

Yottabyte

Brontobyte

Gegobyte

Now how many bytes in them as well:

⅛             Bit

½             Nibble/Nybble/Nyble

1              Byte

1024         Kilobyte

1024^2      Megabyte

1024^3      Gigabyte

1024^4      Terabyte

1024^5      Petabyte

1024^6      Exabyte

1024^7      Zettabyte

1024^8      Yottabyte

1024^9      Brontobyte

1024^10    Gegobyte

In case you didn't know, 2^2 would be 2x2, 2^3 would be 2x2x2 etc.

Finally, excluding nibbles and bits, each unit is the previous unit multiplied by 1024.
