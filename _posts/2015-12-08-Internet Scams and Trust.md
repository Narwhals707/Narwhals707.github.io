**Internet Scams and Trust:**

The internet is a great place, with lots of helpful tools and such. Unfortunately, there are sometimes people who want money out of you, or just to ruin your day. These people are known as scammers. They can use e-mails, pop-ups and more to scam you.

	The first scam is basic. They ask for, say, £750 and say they'll return £750,000 for whatever reason. They then take your money. They say they need your bank account details to transfer it, and they can then take all your money.

	Another type of scam is through pop-ups, or advertisements. They tell you something like "Congratulations! You just won £1000 and an iPhone 6s!" with a button saying O.K. under it. Like before, they'll need all your details for this.

   Alternatively, the link sends a virus onto your computer, not a pretty sight.

Now, more into trust. Here's a question: How much do you trust Wikipedia? BBC News? You probably use them almost daily. These sites can’t always be trusted though.

	Firstly, Wikipedia. Anyone can edit it. Not a good start. Not everything on there can be trusted, either. For instance, I've heard Fiji has 33 islands. I’ve also heard it contains 333 rather small islands. Wikipedia says "over 332".

   This leads into my next point. If Wikipedia says the world contains over 6 continents, it is right, but not very specific. It could be 1,000 continents, it could be 10. Yet another thing not to be trusted about Wikipedia.

	However, Wikipedia has kept some good. If there is unsourced evidence, it says at the top and it says "[citation needed]" above the unsourced sentence.

	Onto BBC news. BBC news is a very biased site to be trusted less than Wikipedia. Let's say that that there was a bomb detonated in Austria. If the BBC was part of the bombing, or just hated Austria for whatever reason, they would make it seem less significant ("Controlled explosion in Austria’s countryside injures a pig" rather than “Bomb detonated in an Austrian superstore, kills and injures 1,000s”).

   This is a massive amount of contrast in a not-at-all debatable situation.

To conclude, I think that the internet can be trusted if you know what you're doing, but it’s best to stay away from these things.
