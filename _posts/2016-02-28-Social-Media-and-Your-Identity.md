Social Media and Your Identity.

Believe it or not, people on social media know lots about you. You just can't escape it. Even posting a picture of a dog failing to reach a tennis ball, or a .gif file of someone bungee jumping, people can tell your interests.

	To illustrate this point, we made "identity maps", something showing off your “good side”; everything you're happy sharing with the world. Unfortunately, we needed key points on our posters for consistency, and some failed that task, making some disappointingly low marks appear.

	Luckily, the people who did what they were asked all got at least a B so, not all bad.

We also found out how people's brains work at different speeds, perhaps unintentionally.

When we looked at a jokey picture of plans filled with illusions and abnormal names. It took some 5 seconds to comprehend it, others 5 minutes.

At least we got there in the end though...
