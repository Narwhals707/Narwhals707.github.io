    <td>We learned lots about coding first-hand today, as we were generally left to do our own work. We managed to get set up quickly as we chose a good position around the outside to get our FUZE boxes working as soon as possible. This was a good strategy and we should be able to maintain this efficiency.</td>

    <td>After we completed Task 1, Nick wanted to create a rainbow using what he had learned. This would've been fine, but he wasn’t changing much of the code, which meant we weren’t learning anything new. Next time, we should add something else, if we are trying something out, as otherwise it is a waste of time.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time, we should get more work done before we go off topic, if we are going to. Alternatively, we could just not go off topic. This would mean that we learn more in the lesson. The problem with the first solution is we might not be right, and we could waste a large portion of the lesson just trying to figure out something which might be in the next chapter. Of course, there is always the latter solution, and we can always try out these things once we have completed the booklet.</td>
