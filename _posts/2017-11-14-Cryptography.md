    <td>At the start of the lesson, we were given improvements to our blogs. This was very helpful as it gave a second opinion on the blog and we were also told some extra things we could to to make our blog more appealing. Afterwards, as this was a new topic, we had to establish what cryptography was. Once we had done that, we went through the Caesar cipher, so that we could go off on our own and create a spreadsheet that will encipher and decipher a message you enter into it. There was an example at the front, but as you could not see the lines of code in each box it was very hard to copy off of, and instead it acted as a template. Personally, I did not find this necessary, but I can see how it would be useful as a template if you were struggling with where to start on it.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I didn't find anything particularly limiting but I would’ve liked to add a way of being able to type the code into a box and have it enciphered/deciphered, instead of having to write the word with one letter in each box. I know how I would make this work, but I do not know the code to make it happen. Other than that, I also found that the spreadsheet only went from A-Z on the x axis, meaning that I would run out of space if I wanted to type a sentence, or a particularly long word. However, I found that this lesson went very smoothly overall.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time, I will see if I am able to implement the line of code that I mentioned above, as it would make it a lot easier to type out the sentence/word. One thing I have changed in preparation for next lesson is that now I can change the number each letter is shifted by (each letter is shifted 3 spaces along so A=D, B=E etc.). I don’t think that there is much else that I can change next lesson but I did enjoy challenging myself with this at home so I think I will work on my spreadsheet more at home as well. This will also consequently help me during the lesson as I will have a better understanding of the commands. Overall, though, I already find the lessons to be very productive and there isn’t a whole lot to change.</td>
