In today's IT lesson, we worked some more on making our names in 3D. I found one way of making things easier while I was working, by adding two turtles into the code. This allowed me to easily go back on my 2D shapes to make them 3D without having to find the center again, as I thought that my turtle was slightly off-center.

I managed to finish my 3D lettering today, but I do still think that there are some more things that I can add though. I could try to add a background or change the line width for example. I also cut a couple of corners while I was making it, such as not rounding the inside of my 'U', so I need to go back and change those.

Overall, I found it very fun to work on this, and it's very satisfying to see your code work. I find it challenging to get some of the parts of it to work, and often the code will not work, but it’s luckily rather easy to fix the mistakes as it’s obvious if a line or a distance is incorrect.
