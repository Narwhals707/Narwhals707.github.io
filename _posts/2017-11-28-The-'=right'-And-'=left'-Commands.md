    <td>In this lesson, we had much the same demonstration as the other lessons, where we would all gather around the front and learn about something (e.g. some code, a process, a word's meaning). In this lesson, we were taught how to use the =left and =right commands, and how to assemble them to 'reverse concatenate’ something. However, we were not told the specific code, so we used trial and improvement in order to solve it. I ended up with a functional piece of code, however all boxes 2 or more spaces after the end of the word/sentence had an error message (#NUM) as the subtraction I did would give a result of -1.</td>

    <td>I think I worked pretty well this lesson, however I need to make sure that I sometimes take a step back and look at exactly what is happening, instead of simply trying out some random idea and hoping it works. This way I’ll hopefully be able to spot the flaws in my code quicker as everything will not make sense in the bigger picture. It also might be be helpful to try completely redoing my code at points, so that I won’t easily overlook a mistake. For instance, the word ‘be’ is repeated twice above, but it’s hard to notice that the first time reading it. Even if it does seem intimidating deleting everything, it might be more helpful in the long run.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time, I hope to fix all of the error messages I see in the sheet - even if they don’t affect the actual output. I will also try dissecting my code, or possibly even deleting it, in order to find all of the problems in it. I find that it is a whole lot quicker to reassemble the code once I have found the problem than I usually anticipate, so it would be a good idea for me to take apart the whole thing, instead of adding in one space and hoping it fixes everything. While both paths will eventually reach the solution, the former option would be a lot faster in the long run.</td>
