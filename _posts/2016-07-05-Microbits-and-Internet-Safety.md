Microbits and Internet Safety:

After a long delay, the microbits have finally arrived, and they are working. We got them set up this lesson, and spend a bit of time fiddling around on them, downloading (or attempting to download) code onto our microbit. However, this wasn't the primary focus of the lesson.

	We talked a lot about the usages of social media, which are abundant. Here's a list for you:

	.

* Meeting up with friends and distant family members.

* A way to communicate

* Entertainment

* Sharing of information

* Sexting

* Radicalisation

* Pornography

* Grooming/Paedophiles

As this list clearly shows, social media can be used for both good and bad. The bad side is a shame for some people, particularly home workers/distant relatives, as they would like to communicate.

	Obviously, there's a safe way to use social media, and it’s quite simple. Just follow these 3 simple steps:

1. Don't put personal information online. It’s surprising what people can do with it.

* This includes DOB, full name, where you live, postcode, etc.

     2.   Don't communicate with other people on a personal level.

     3.   If someone is sexting or violating rules, tell a responsible and/or trusted person.
