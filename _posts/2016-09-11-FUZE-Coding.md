    <td>We learned how to set up the boxes firsthand, and did so in the lesson. Pairwork was effective as we could help each other out if we were stuck. We also did a bit of coding once we set it up, but we had to work in a three as one pair couldn't get theirs to work. We had one person reading the instructions, one person reading the extra information and one person typing in the instructions.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>We needed help as we werenâ€™t allowed to unplug anything under the floor, which meant it took a bit longer to get set up. Also, it was harder to read from the book as we were in a three and so it was harder to see what it said. We could fix this by having the book we were reading from in the middle (on the table) and we could form a semicircle so we can all see the book. Another idea is to have each of us switching roles after each page.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>To help next time, we could employ one of the techniques mentioned above (preferably the latter) to help with reading. Also, rather than sitting on the island in the middle, we could sit around the outside ring, as there is no plugs to be removed under the floor there, but instead in the wall. This would all ultimately mean we could set up the FUZE boxes (and carry out instructions) quicker, meaning we could get more done in the lesson.</td>
