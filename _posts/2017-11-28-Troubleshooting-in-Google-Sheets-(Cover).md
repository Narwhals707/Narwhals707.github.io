    <td>In today's lesson, we learned a bit differently to usual, because it was a cover lesson. Instead of having a demonstration at the front, we were simply given a task and we had to perform it within the hour we had. This wasn’t ideal, as it meant that we would have difficulty performing any work at a higher level to what we had done before, so we ended up finishing up our enciphering code (which meant lots of troubleshooting for me). Using google to learn how commands such as 'or’ work was very helpful for me at least, as oftentimes the code is different to that that we are used to (i.e. different to in Python).</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Aside from the obvious fact that we couldn’t tackle anything new, I don’t think anything limited me today. I managed to finish off the work that I was doing, and I had some time to spare, so I helped some people with their code as well. I definitely need to work on changing larger portions of my code at a time, as it has proved to be very effective this lesson; it probably took half the time to perform everything than it would’ve, had I not employed this tactic. Overall, I’d say that this lesson was as productive as it could’ve been for me.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time, i will make sure to employ the strategies I mentioned in my previous post and above (make larger changes to my work at one time instead of changing lots of little details). Hopefully this way I will be able to work way more productively than I would’ve been able to do before I started trying this. One thing which I might try for next lesson is looking for different ways to approach the same problem - instead of doing a really complicated line of code involving several sets of brackets there might be a way to do the code only using a couple of commands. This way I might be able to drastically cut down on the time it takes for me to finish everything, should I manage to find an easy way around something.</td>
