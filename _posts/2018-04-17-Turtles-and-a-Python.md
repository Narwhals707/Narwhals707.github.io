In this lesson, we looked at using python to code a 'turtle', a tool that can draw a 2D shape from scratch. We spent some time going over the fairly straightforward rules of the turtle before getting on with the task of drawing a series of shapes. I found this fairly easy, and I finished in good time, but I think that I could’ve gone back and tried to incorporate more advanced code into it, such as changing the colour, width, and length of the lines. 

It took quite a bit of time to work out all the angles the turtle needs to turn to create different shapes, but by the end of the lesson I got much quicker at it. It is more difficult than it seems at first glance, as instead of using interior angles to work out the amount the turtle needs to turn, you need to use exterior angles (180-interior). I still feel that working out these angles is something that I could improve upon.

However, I did manage to find a way of saving lots of time this lesson. By adding in a simple line of code at the start I've managed to make it so that instead of writing 'turtle.’ at the start of each line, I now only have to write ‘t.’. I think that this will become particularly useful later as I begin to write much more code using the turtle.
