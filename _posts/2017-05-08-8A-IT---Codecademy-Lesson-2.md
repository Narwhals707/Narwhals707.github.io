    <td>I learned almost exactly the same way as last week. I went through the provided course and helped some other people as well. The easiest way for me to make progress is by helping people as I go as it helps me revise the topics I've previously covered. I found it a lot easier to read the text on the left before I dived into the actual code because it helps me build up an understanding of how the code works. It essentially goes "Here’s an example. Now try it yourself." Obviously it’s going to be difficult without an example as you don’t have the faintest idea what to do then.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I believe I still rushed the section before the final test too much as I left out a line of code (return true) and I got stuck on “The Final Test” for a while. Also, I was unable to find where I saved the pictures onto my Google Drive and so I cannot find my badges. I have created an IT folder so this will not happen in the future. Other than that question, I did not get stuck anywhere.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will save my badges to the IT folder so I don’t lose them, and make sure to slow down so that I understand where everything is necessary as well as how to write down the code itself. This way I will get through 2+ chapters every lesson instead of 1 and reach the end of the course before the end of term. The badges may still be recoverable if the Recycle Bin hasn’t been emptied, as I can find them there and then add them to this document and repost it.</td>
