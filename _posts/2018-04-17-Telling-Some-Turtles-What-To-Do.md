In today's lesson, we began to start working on a larger task, where we write our names in block capitals. In order to do this, we had to learn how to create curves. It would be simple if it was not for the fact that we can’t just do 'move forward 1 unit, turn 1 degree’ because that would create a massive circle that we don’t want. Instead, we had to get creative and use decimals/fractions to work it out.

I found the most difficult part to be getting the curves to work, and it did take me a couple of tries to figure out exactly how to make it work. I feel like I would've wasted a lot less time if I just kept trying things instead of spending a long time thinking about how I could change things as I think it is likely that I would come across the solution sooner that way.

Overall, I think that today's lesson was very successful as I managed to get each of the 2D letters in block capitals as I wanted. However, I feel like I could’ve finished a lot sooner if I stopped worrying about the code not working as intended and I tried more things sooner. It was very satisfying to see the turtle draw out a pattern from my code when it all worked.
