  <tr>
    <td>I learnt much the same way as the last few weeks, as always. I think that being ahead in the course is giving me (and others) more of an advantage, because I can usually help with their situations using more knowledge than they may have at that point. For instance, I had to help Seth last week with some code because the information at the side was wrong, and I used some knowledge from later on to help find the problem. This is also helping me revise the previous topics, as I often forget things after I learn them, and then I have to go back and start over, but I can still remember things like powers (**) because I had to go back and help people with them.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think both Seth and I were getting distracted by somebody (I won't give a specific name) pushing himself in between us, I assume to get noticed. It really hindered me because I barely managed to reach my target, even with the lead I had from last week. I think I need to be less easily distracted by other things, but on the other hand I still don’t think that it is entirely my fault that I didn’t get much work done, as I did repeatedly ask him to stop moving me (and his chair). I’m still not going to put all of the blame on him, though, as I am quite easily distracted unless I really get going and start working quickly, as evidenced by last week.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time, I’ll try not to get as easily distracted, and see if I can reach the level I achieved last week, because I was working really well then. I also think that I need to keep on revising the past topics, as I keep saying, because it is necessary so that I don’t forget things. The Q&A Forums are really helpful for me to get through the work, because oftentimes I see other people experiencing the same problems as me, and it is really nice to be given an explanation of the situation instead of an answer. Sometimes it’s just me making silly mistakes (such as putting dictionaries in quotation marks), which I do need to watch out for because it can cost me a lot of time if I don’t notice the mistake and keep changing the rest of my code and breaking it more and more until I have to reset it. </td>
