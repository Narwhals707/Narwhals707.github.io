    <td>I learnt the same way as the previous weeks. I worked through the course but I did learn a couple of new things. Firstly, I noticed that the glossary button will contain all of the previous information we have covered (and some later on), which made me notice another thing. Seth (who I sit next to) was stuck on a problem where Codecademy tells you to use the instruction [1:len(new_word)] to get characters 2 onward in your word. However, using Ctrl+F and the glossary, I found out that we were meant to use new_word[1:] instead in Seth's code. Finally, I realised the importance of using copy and paste. While this sounds like cheating, it saves a lot of time. For instance, I was asked to copy out a piece of code 3 times (about 4 lines long each time, but I could just copy and paste the code, and change some values. By doing this I can save about 2-3 minutes while still understanding the code. After we did a bit of coding, we also took a look through our blogs. I now know that I need to add more colour to my blog; to do that without messing up the table I need to create a box around all of the text.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I may have spent a little bit too long on Seth’s code, but I think that the real limiting factor was how Codecademy has incorrect instructions down the side, because that limited Seth and forced me to spend some time trying to work it out. I think I need to spend less time worrying about other people’s work, especially because there are so many tools to use to find out the answer (I think that the Q&A forum is the most helpful, because it also explains why the code is wrong). I also need to make sure my blog looks nicer than it does right now, but I’m really happy with how IT is going right now.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time, I think I still need to spend more time on my code and worry less about other people (they can figure it out by themselves, hopefully). I also need to use copy and paste to work faster, and I need to make sure that I don’t dive straight in after I have a basic understanding of the code and how it works, but instead I should plan it out in my head so I don’t waste time typing it all up, only to delete it again. Overall, though, I’m pretty happy with how I’m working through the course.</td>
