Binary and Hexadecimal

Binary and Hexadecimal. You might've heard of them, you might not have. They’re used in computers for storing data. They simply work in different "bases". Binary works in base 2, hence BInary. Hexadecimal works in base 16, hence HEXADECimal.

	Binary is simple. 2 digits used, 1 and 0. Here's a table.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>8
(EIGHT)</td>
    <td>4
(FOUR)</td>
    <td>2
(TWO)</td>
    <td>1
(ONE)</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>0 (ZERO)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>1 (ONE)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>

    <td>1</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>2 (TWO)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>

    <td>1</td>

  <tr>

  </tr>
  <tr>

    <td>0</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>5 (FIVE)</td>
  </tr>
</table>


<table>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>6 (SIX)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>

    <td>1</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>7 (SEVEN)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>8 (EIGHT)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>9 (NINE)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>

    <td>10 (TEN)</td>

What does this mean? The numbers on the side are what the 1's and 0’s represent and the numbers on the top are there to guide you.

Take 6 for example. Look at all the columns with ones in. Look at the top of those columns. Add up those numbers. It adds up to six. You just converted binary into base 10.

     To convert it back, do this in reverse. 6=_+_?. 4+2=6. Put ones in those columns. Done.

Hexadecimal looks slightly harder but isn't. Here’s another table.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>1 (ONE)</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>0 (ZERO)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>1 (ONE)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>2 (TWO)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>3 (THREE)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>4 (FOUR)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>5 (FIVE)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>6</td>
    <td>6 (SIX)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>7</td>
    <td>7 (SEVEN)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>8</td>
    <td>8 (EIGHT)</td>
  </tr>
</table>


<table>
  <tr>
    <td>9</td>
    <td>9 (NINE)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>A</td>
    <td>10 (TEN)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>B</td>
    <td>11 (ELEVEN)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>C</td>
    <td>12 (TWELVE)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>D</td>
    <td>13 (THIRTEEN)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>E</td>
    <td>14 (FOURTEEN)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>15 (FIFTEEN)</td>
  </tr>
</table>


Notice the addition of letters? There were no more digits. Simple as that.

	Just like with binary, once that columns filled up, it would start the next one.

So 16 would be 10, 256 would be 100 etc. 

     If you want the column at the top, expand it by multiplying the largest number by 16 (so it would go 1, 16, 256. 4096, 65536, 1048576, 16777216 and so on until you reach infinity).

	Now, computer storage. Storage is done in bits, nibbles, bytes etc. This is the last table.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Bytes in a ___</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1/8</td>
    <td>Bit</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1/2</td>
    <td>Nibble/Nybble/Nyble</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>Byte</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1024</td>
    <td>Kilobyte</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1024^2</td>
    <td>Megabyte</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1024^3</td>
    <td>Gigabyte</td>
  </tr>
</table>


<table>
  <tr>
    <td>1024^4</td>
    <td>Terabyte</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1024^5</td>
    <td>Petabyte</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1024^6</td>
    <td>Exabyte</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1024^7</td>
    <td>Zettabyte</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1024^8</td>
    <td>Yottabyte</td>
  </tr>
</table>


<table>
  <tr>
    <td>1024^9</td>
    <td>Brontobyte</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1024^10</td>
    <td>Gegobyte</td>
  </tr>
</table>


The table is pretty self-explanatory.

In case you didn't know, 2^2 would be 2x2, 2^3 would be 2x2x2 etc.

Finally, excluding nibbles and bits, each unit is the previous unit multiplied by 1024.
